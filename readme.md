# Ong_Trading
My personal event-driven backtesting library, based on the series https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I/ (up to https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-VIII/)
.

The original idea in quantstart is extended to support:
* Bid-Offer spread
* Stocks
* Stocks with Tobin Tax
* CfD
* CfD with Ig overnight commissions

**Work in progress**
